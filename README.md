# THERMODYNAMIC TABLES

In my first semester of university I took the Themodynamics course. It required reading several thermodynamic properties from our textbook for each question. Instead of flipping through pages and calculating properties I had the idea to automate this and create a properties Calculator.

This python programs automates the reading of thermodynamic tables from pdf files by converting it to tabular data and using pandas to query data from it.

Tables.py file converts PDF data to csv files.

main.py file creates an interactive menu to query data from csv files.

This program only supports the saturated properties of the substances in our course. Support for Superheated Tables will be added soon.

The folder can be downloaded and used by running the main.py file in any IDE.
